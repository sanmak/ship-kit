# Stage and Commit

Stage files, enforce sensitive-file checks, run build triggers, review the diff, generate a conventional commit message, and commit.

## Context

- Config: !`cat .shipkit.json 2>/dev/null || echo '{}'`
- Git status: !`git status --porcelain`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Staged files: !`git diff --cached --name-only`

## Procedure

### 1. Auto-Stage Changed Files

Stage all changed files:

```bash
git add -A
```

If the caller provides a specific list of files (e.g., from `/deslop` or `/pr-fix`), stage only those files instead.

### 2. Call detect-sensitive Skill

Run the `detect-sensitive` skill against all staged files (`git diff --cached --name-only`).

If any sensitive files are detected:
- Print the blocking report from `detect-sensitive`
- **Abort immediately** — do not proceed to build triggers or commit
- Return with `blocked: true` and the list of matches

### 3. Check Build Triggers

Read `build.triggers` from config. For each trigger entry:

1. Get the list of staged files: `git diff --cached --name-only`
2. Match staged files against the trigger's `watch` patterns (glob matching)
3. If any staged file matches:
   - Run the trigger's `run` command (e.g., `npm run build`)
   - If the command fails, **abort** with the error output
   - Stage the trigger's `stage` output files (e.g., `git add dist/`)

If no `build.triggers` are configured, skip this step entirely.

### 4. Regenerate Checksums (if enabled)

If `checksums.enabled` is `true`:

1. For each file in `checksums.files`, compute SHA-256:
   ```bash
   shasum -a 256 <file>
   ```
2. Write results to `checksums.file` (default: `CHECKSUMS.sha256`)
3. Stage the checksums file: `git add <checksums.file>`

If `checksums` is not configured or `enabled` is `false`, skip this step.

### 5. Review Diff

Display the staged diff for review:

```bash
git diff --cached --stat
git diff --cached
```

Analyze the diff to understand what changed. This informs the commit message generation.

### 6. Generate Conventional Commit Message

Based on the diff analysis, generate a commit message following conventional commit format:

**Format**: `<type>(<optional-scope>): <description>`

Use prefixes from `commit.conventionalPrefixes` config, or defaults:
- `feat` — new feature
- `fix` — bug fix
- `chore` — maintenance, dependencies
- `docs` — documentation only
- `test` — test additions/changes
- `refactor` — code restructuring without behavior change

**Rules:**
- Subject line: imperative mood, lowercase, no period, max 72 chars
- Choose the type that best matches the majority of changes
- Scope is optional — use when changes are clearly scoped to a module/component
- If `commit.coAuthor` is configured, append it as a trailer

**Example:**
```
feat(auth): add OAuth provider configuration

- Add OAuthProvider interface
- Implement Google and GitHub providers
- Add provider factory with auto-detection

Co-authored-by: Name <email>
```

### 7. Commit

Create the commit:

```bash
git commit -m "<generated message>"
```

**Rules:**
- Never use `--no-verify` — always let git hooks run
- If the commit fails (e.g., hook failure), report the error and abort
- Do not amend previous commits

### 8. Return Result

Report the result:

- `committed: true`
- `sha` — the commit SHA (`git rev-parse HEAD`)
- `message` — the commit message used
- `files` — list of staged files
- `buildTriggersRun` — list of build triggers that were executed (if any)

**Success output:**
```
✓ Committed <short-sha>: <commit message>
  <N> files changed
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Sensitive files detected | Abort with blocking report |
| Build trigger command fails | Abort with command output |
| No changes to commit | Report "Nothing to commit" and exit cleanly |
| Commit hook failure | Report hook output, do not retry with --no-verify |

## Notes

- This skill is the most composed skill in ShipKit — called by `/commit`, `/ship`, `/ship-pr`, `/pr-fix`, `/loop-on-ci`, `/hotfix`, and `/deslop`
- Callers may override the auto-stage behavior by providing specific files
- The commit message is always generated fresh — never reuse a previous message
- Build triggers are order-independent (each trigger watches its own patterns)
